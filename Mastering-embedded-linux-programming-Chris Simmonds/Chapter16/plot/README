Notes on generating the latency diagrams
----------------------------------------

First you will need gnuplot. Everything is done at the
command-line, so you can install the smaller "no X" package:

$ sudo apt-get install gnuplot-nox

Then, to generate the plots from the data files, run the do-plot file:

$ gnuplot do-plot
